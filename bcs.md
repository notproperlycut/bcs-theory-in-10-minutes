# Superconductivity

---
---

The complete absence of electrical resistance at low enough temperatures

--

... in the right materials

---

There are two types

---

## Type 1 superconductors

--

- Discovered by Kamerlingh Onnes 1911
- Mostly metals
 - eg. Niobium
- Superconduct at very low temperatures (use liquid Helium ~4K)
- Meisnner effect: repel magnetic fields

---

## Type 2 superconductors

--

- More recent, 1930s-
- Metallic alloys, ceramics
 - eg Sn12SbTe11Ba2V2Mg24O50+
- Some superconduct at higher temperatures (use liquid Nitrogen ~80K)
- Incomplete Meisnner effect
- Less well understood

---

## BCS theory

--

- Developed by Bardeen, Cooper, and Schrieffer in 1957
- Deals with Type 1 superconductors
- Nobel Prize in 1972

## Wave-particle duality

--

Quantum mechanics says that a small thing can act as both a particle and a wave at the same time

--

eg. photon in two-slit inteference experiment

---

## Quantisation

--

The Schrödinger equation predicts that properties of particles will sometimes be quantised.

--

This means the properties take discreet values only: "Quantum states"

--

- Commonly quantised properties: energy (usually), spin
- Usually not quantised: position, momentum, energy (sometimes)

--

## Quantisation

Think about wave interference in a constrained space

--

- Quantum potential well
- Particles in a box

# Fundamental particles

---

## Fermions

--

- Half-integer spin (1/2, 3/2)
- Fermi–Dirac statistics
- Subject to Pauli exclusion principle
 - **Cannot occupy the same quantum state**
- Examples: electron, proton

--

## Bosons

--

- Integer spin (0, 1)
- Bose-Einstein statistics
- Not subject to Pauli exclusion principle
 - **Can occupy the same quantum state**
- Examples: photon, Higgs boson

# Quantum mechanics

## Bose-Einstein Condensation

--

Low temperatures 
- Bosons lose energy and fall into lower energy quantum states
- Eventually occupy same (lowest energy) "ground" quantum state
- Bose-Einstein condensation

--

Particles in a Bose-Einstein Condensate "lock" together.

They **behave as one particle** subject to quantum mechanics

# Fundamental particles

## Gauge bosons and fundamental forces

- Some fundamental bosons are gauge bosons
- The fundamental forces of physics act when particles exchange gauge bosons

--

The electromagnetic force acting between two electrons involves the exchange of a photon

# Solid-state physics

## Free electrons in a conductor

DIAGRAM

--

- Not bound to a single ion
- Move through the lattice of ions
- Carry electrical current
- Collide with ions -> electrical resistance

---

## Free electrons in a conductor

DIAGRAM

--

Increase temperature -> ions vibrate more -> more collisions -> higher electrical resistance

--

Decrease temperature -> ions vibrate less -> fewer collisions -> lower electrical resistance

---

## Phonons

DIAGRAM

Attraction between moving electrons and lattice ions -> Lattice vibrations

--

Vibrations are quantised -> "Phonons"

--

Wave-particle duality:
- Phonons are quasi-particles
- Phonons are bosons

---

## Phonons

DIAGRAM

- Phonons are bosons
- They exchange force between electrons (although they're not really gauge bosons)
- Interaction between electrons and phonons causes attractive force between electrons
- Attractive force -> potential well for pairs of electrons

---

## Phonons

DIAGRAM

Leon Cooper showed: 

**Any** amount of attractive force between electrons

--

is sufficient to create at least one bound quantum state for the pair

---

# Cooper pair

--

Pair of weakly bound electrons

--

Bound electrons are not necessarily close to each other.

They are bound by lattice phonons over (atomically) long distances

--

They travel in opposite directions, with the same speed

--
 
Sum of two half-integer spins means... the composite particle has integer spin

--

**Cooper pairs are bosons**

---

layout: true

# We're there!

---

---

## At room temperature

--

Few Cooper pairs (they're weakly bound)

--

Mostly free electrons (which are fermions)

--

Classical electrical resistance

---

## At low temperature

--
Lower thermal energy

--

Free electrons end up bound in Cooper pairs (which are bosons)

--

Cooper pairs lose energy and fall to the ground quantum state

--

They form a Bose-Einstein Condensate

---

## At low temperature

In the condensate:

--

The paired electrons behave as one particle (boson) that spans the lattice

--

Individual electrons no longer see the ion lattice

--

They are effectively too big to collide with the lattice ions

--

**Zero electrical resistance**
